# DLSU_surveillancebot
General Objective
To design and implement a semi-autonomous robot that can aid the
security personnel in monitoring and surveying the main grounds of De
La Salle University Manila.
Specific Objectives
1. To design and construct a mobile robot that can follow a distinct
line for at least 5 minutes with an accuracy of at least 90% for an
autonomous survey capability on a specific area.
(Why 5 minutes???)
2. To develop a controller that is able to separately control both the
head of the robot for vision control when transmitting video signals
in real time, and the body of the robot for navigational controls with
a latency of less than 200ms.
(Is this controller app-based or leap or others?)
3. To design and implement an obstacle avoidance algorithm for a
safety mechanism in both on its remote-controlled state and in its
autonomous state during the span of its operation with an accuracy of
at least 70%.
(Why 70 %?)
4. To design and implement a voice recognition-based system that is
capable of doing the specific instructions with a voice recognition
accuracy of at least 70%.
(Is this for control? Why 70 %?)
Lacking in the objectives:
An important component of the robot is navigation... What terrain can
it follow? just flat concrete? can it climb stairs as well or will it
get stuck in a ditch?
Is it connected to the network all the time? What is the battery
power? Will it last for more that an hour? Will the robot
automatically recharge?
Do we process the video?
